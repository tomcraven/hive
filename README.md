Hive (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hive_%28game%29) implementation with an AI interface

My friends and I occasionally play the Hive board game and almost every time talk about how we would implement an AI to play our turns for us.

This project is an implementation of the game with an interface to write an AI to play each turn.

It's currently very under tested, with no unit tests. So I wouldn't be surprised if there are a lot of bugs.

### Usage
python hive.py path/to/ai.py path/to/ai.py

There must be 2 ai scripts to play against each other. They can be the same script
